## Vulnerability & Exploit Research

### National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
NVD tracks CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and indicates whether a public exploit exists.

CVE format:
CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER

NVD is ideal when researching vulnerabilities in specific software versions.

### Exploit Database (ExploitDB)
ExploitDB is widely used in CTFs and penetration tests as it often contains ready-to-use exploits.

### searchsploit (Kali Linux)
Kali Linux includes searchsploit, which allows offline searching of the ExploitDB database.

searchsploit apache

All exploit files are already stored locally on the system.
