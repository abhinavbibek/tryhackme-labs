# Cybersecurity Practices and Laboratories

It is my practice in hands-on cybersecurity activities and notes on lab work stored in this repository, mainly, on the basis of TryHackMe learning paths. This repository is aimed at recording my practiced, tools utilized, and the most important concepts that I have acquired in the process of establishing a solid ground on cybersecurity.

Instead of concentrating on a completion of rooms, this repository pays attention to learning, procedure, and a lesson learned after each laboratory. This is all personally learned as I write and influenced by my approach to every topic as I practiced.
